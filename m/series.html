                        are in Professional Institutions, and are getting ready
                        to take their first step into a career in the corporate
                        world.</p>
                      <p>Employers look for a set of skills in the recruit.
                        Among them, the technical skills are covered extensively
                        in the institutions. Given any challenge, most of the
                        students will be able to handle them competently, as
                        long as they require the technical skills learnt in
                        their institutions.</p>
                      <p>Unfortunately, technical skills happen to be just one
                        among the various skills that decide whether the
                        recruits bags their first career opening. Most of these
                        other essential skills are not covered in most of the

                      <p>In any organization, the top management would always
                        prefer to have the most competent employees to manage
                        and lead the organization to higher growth. This is not
                        just true for the top management posts, but every level
                        of the organizational hierarchy. Employees are given
                        promotions to handle higher responsibilities and to take
                        charge of teams to achieve this growth trajectory, based
                        on their performance in their existing level.</p>
                      <p>In majority of such promotions, the promoted employee
                        moves over from an executive role to a managerial role.
                        The skill sets, that helped him/her to achieve the
                        required high performance, suddenly changes, and as a
                        manager, he/she requires a totally different skill set
                        to perform in the new role. This is a typical "Hotspot",
                        where and intervention is required to prepare them for
                        their new role. They have to be exposed to these new
                        skill sets, and it has to be done in such a way that
                        these new promotees can experience how to use these
                        skills and its effect, in a controlled environment.</p>
                      <p>The Accelerator Series aims to provide such
                        interventions in an effective manner, so that these
                        promotees are able to relate to the situations when they
                        actually take over the new responsibilities. This series
                        of Training Programs is focused on Corporate training,
                        where employees need to be fine-tuned in the areas as
                        required by the organization.</p>
                      <p>The Accelerator Series programs are of 3 days duration,
                        and are generally "stretch" programs, where the
                        participants will be stretched for time, activity, and
                        tight schedule. Ideally the program starts with outdoor
                        activities and games around 6:00 am, and run through the
                        day till about 12:00 midnight. These programs are
                        "Out-Bound Training" programs and follow the principles
                        of "Experiential Learning". The methodology used here
                        would be Games &amp; Activities, where the learning are
                        brought out through experience, Group Discussions,
                        Movies etc. with a minimum of Power Point/Lecture
                        sessions.</p>
                      <p>The Accelerator Series has 4 variations, focusing on
                        four distinct areas where training interventions may be
                        required. They are :</p>
