<h2>SOFT SKILLS</h2>
	</font></p><p><font size=3 color=#000000>
The foundation for success is built on three pillars, namely Attitude, Skills and Knowledge. Knowledge tells us "What to Do", Skills directs us "How to Do" and finally Attitude explains "Why to Do" !! Attitude is the will to do something. Unless all these pillars are adequately strong, success will keep eluding us.
	</font></p><p><font size=3 color=#000000>
At every stage of our career, these three pillars will need to be re-strengthened ! Each role requires a different skill-set. The changed location or situation could also affect the "will to do". Hence, these three pillars need constant fine-tuning and tweeking.
	</font></p></div></div>



	<div id="2" class="modalDialog_index"><br><div><a href="" title="Close" class="close">x</a>
<h2>HOTSPOTS</h2>
	</font></p><p><font size=3 color=#000000>
Hotspots are those points of our career, where our Skills & Attitude is put to test. We need to be prepared for tese "Moments of Truth".
	</font></p><p><font size=3 color=#000000>
These are the points in our career where changes take place. A student joining his first job, moves from a world of theory to a world of practice. The corporate world expects a lot from him, which may be in the form of knowledge, skills or attitude. Such situations are also common when promotions take place, when a previous team member employee may suddenly be thrust into a role of a team leader.
	</font></p></div></div>



	<div id="3" class="modalDialog_index"><br><div><a href="" title="Close" class="close">x</a>
<h2>APPLICABLE INDUSTRIES</h2>
	</font></p><p><font size=3 color=#000000>
Each industry may have specific knowledge requirements and related technical skill-sets, which may be industry specific. However, Soft Skills and related knowledge are not industry specific. Any industry where human beings work "together" and need to "interact" with each other, these Soft Skills are required. These could also include Social Skills, Interpersonal Skills, Communication Skills, Analytical Skills etc..
	</font></p><p><font size=3 color=#000000>
Gaining mastery over these will stand by us in any role, in whichever industry we choose to be a part of.
	</font></p></div></div>



	<div id="4" class="modalDialog_index"><br><div><a href="" title="Close" class="close">x</a>
<h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
	</font></p><p><font size=3 color=#000000>
Since all the participants are adults, and the focus on Soft Skill training, the principles of andragogy takes on importance.
	</font></p><p><font size=3 color=#000000>
Adults come with their own experiences, related knowledge, skills and attitude. They have their own view point when interacting with the society. Hence, the fundamental premise of the sessions should be that "No one is wrong... Everyone is right from their point of view". We follow this approach, and then help each participant to observe the same situation from a different point of view, so that their approach to each specific situation can change.
	</font></p></div></div>



	<div id="5" class="modalDialog_index"><br><div><a href="" title="Close" class="close">x</a>
<h2>A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH</h2>
	</font></p><p><font size=3 color=#000000>
The actual training deliver is just part of the process. The process begins with Training Need Analysis (TNA), through sessions with different line manageres and departmental heads. We identify the need for training, and try to discover gaps in the participants. Based on these interventions, tailor-made programs are prepared to fullfill these needs. Pre-deliver, the line namagers are exposed to the modules and their expected results.
	</font></p><p><font size=3 color=#000000>
After the delivery, feedbacks are taken from the line managers, to check the implementation of the learnings by the participants in their actual work environment. If required, further interventions are planned.
	</font></p></div></div>


<!-----
	<div id="6" class="modalDialog_index"><br><div><a href="" title="Close" class="close">x</a>
	<h2>PARTNERS IN GROWTH</h2>
	<p><font size=3 color=#000000>
We do not believe that a Training Programme is a stand-alone activity. Training is always a support activity, and hence is to be used as a tool to achieve corporate goals. Training for the sake of training will not help in any manner. Training has to be focused to fulfill a need that may arise withing the organisation.
	</font></p><p><font size=3 color=#000000>
We try to identify such needs through Training Need Analysis. We try to get feedback from the line managers and Management, about the gap symptoms that may be visible, which has prompted them look to training as a solution. We try to identify the present status of the participants through Psychometric tests and identify gaps. The training programmes are designed to cover these existing gaps.
	</font></p><p><font size=3 color=#000000>
Care is taken to update the line managers and management about the need of the training, along with the effect the selected modules will have to fulfill these needs. It is to be noted that no training will be complete unless it is implemented by the participants. This implementation process will have to be hand-led by the respective line managers. Regular feedbacks will be taken from the line managers to check the level of implementation of the learnings. And finally, the organisation need to identify whether the training interention has resulted in the required behavioural changes in the participants, leading to better ROI.

<h2>TOTAL FLEXIBILITY</h2>
	</font></p><p><font size=3 color=#000000>
We have a Booster Series, where all the Skill Trainings are put under different categories for easy identification. We can tailor-make the training programme by mix-n-match of different modules, as per the requirements based on the training need analysis. The programmes could be fine tuned according to the level of participant experience, though the module will be the same. The differenence would be the depth to which the sessions would delve into, as per the participant maturity and levels.
